        <h1>Welcome to Play Framework </h1>
        <h2> A server-side dynamic web page </h2>
        is a web page whose construction is
        controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. <br>
        <a href="#DOM">Go to DOM</a>
        In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of
        every new web page proceeds, <br> including the setting up of more client-side
        processing. <br>

        <p style="background-color: yellowgreen;color: blue"> <b>A client-side dynamic web page</b> processes the web page using <i>HTML scripting </i>
            running in the browser as it loads.
            <br><BR><br>JavaScript and other scripting languages
            determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the
            <u>Document Object Model, or DOM, </u> that represents the loaded web page. <br><BR><br><br><BR><br>
            <b><i><u>The same client-side techniques</u></i></b> can then dynamically update or change
            <br><BR><br>

            <a name="DOM">
                the DOM in the same way. </a>

        </p>

        <p style="background-color: gainsboro;color: red;">

            A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. <br><BR><br>
            The updating information could come from
            the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. <br>  <br>
            This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to,
            but a dynamic web page update using Ajax technologies will neither
            create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history
            forward of the displayed page. <br><BR><br>
            Using Ajax technologies the end user gets
            one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while
            the actual web content rendered on that page can vary.
            The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, <br><BR><br>
            the DOM, for its client, from an application server.
            <br>  <br>
            DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages. <br>
            Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a
            browser.
